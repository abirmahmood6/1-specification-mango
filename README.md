## Brief App Overview

ClearNote is an app designed for college students to have quick, convenient, yet robust notetaking
capabilities. Our goal is to prioritize loading times and performance so students can quickly
jot down quick notes and ideas to reference later, while also implementing formatting and categorization
functionality so they can stay organized.
